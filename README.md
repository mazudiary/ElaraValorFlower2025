# Flower Day for Elara Valor

A celebratory website created for Elara Valor's birthday on May 15, 2025, which also coincides with Flower Day. The site features a series of beautifully animated pages with personalized messages and interactive elements to make the day special.

- **Lotus Page (`lotus.html`)**: Displays a stunning 3D animated lotus flower with multiple layers of petals that bloom and rotate, accompanied by a birthday message. Includes a link to the moon page.
- **Moon Page (`moon.html`)**: Showcases images of the moon with descriptions related to Elara Valor's birthday, set against a starry night background with twinkling stars and sparkles. Includes buttons to go back to the main page or proceed to the rose page.
- **Rose Page (`rose.html`)**: Features an interactive rose that blooms when hovered over, revealing a birthday message. Background music plays automatically upon page load. Includes a button to proceed to the letter page.
